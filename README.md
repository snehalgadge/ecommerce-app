- **Initial Planning and Understanding:**
  - Began the development of the e-commerce app by thoroughly understanding its components and pages.

- **Home Page Development:**
  - Started the development process with the home page.
  - Implemented core functionality for the home page, including product display and navigation.
  - Added "Add to Cart" functionality directly on the home page for a seamless shopping experience.

- **User Authentication:**
  - Integrated Firebase for user authentication to ensure secure user login and logout.
  - Implemented a user-friendly interface that displays the user's name upon successful login.

- **Redux Store Setup:**
  - Established a Redux store to manage application state efficiently.

- **Shopping Cart Functionality:**
  - Enhanced the shopping experience by adding a cart feature.
  - Within the cart, implemented functions such as:
    - Increasing the quantity of items.
    - Deleting items from the cart.
    - Clearing the entire cart.
    - Calculating the total cart amount.

By following this development approach, the e-commerce app was designed to provide a user-friendly shopping experience with features like user authentication and a fully functional shopping cart powered by Redux.
